Get food results based on 1 of 2 things:
- name of a food
- ingredients 

As cooks there are two things that are most important to us when looking for something new to cook:
 - Ingredients 
 - Steps required to make

Often times we need to scroll through a long blog post to get to the information we really need

Using the [Spoonacular API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) we can retrieve a vast amount of food data and present the most important parts of it - to the user
